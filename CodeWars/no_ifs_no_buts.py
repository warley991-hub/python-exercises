'''
Write a function that accepts two numbers a and b and returns whether a is smaller than, bigger than, or equal to b, as a string.

(5, 4)   ---> "5 is greater than 4"
(-4, -7) ---> "-4 is greater than -7"
(2, 2)   ---> "2 is equal to 2"
There is only one problem...

You cannot use if statements, and you cannot use the ternary operator ? :.

In fact the word if and the character ? are not allowed in your code.

def no_ifs_no_buts(a, b):
    pass # Code here

def no_ifs_no_buts(a, b):
    while a<b: 
         response = f'{a} is smaller than {b}'
         break
    while a>b:
        response = f'{a} is greater than {b}'
        break
    while a==b:
        response = f'{a} is equal to {b}'
        break

    return response
