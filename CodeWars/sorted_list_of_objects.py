'''
You'll be passed a list/array of objects/dictionaries/hashes (depending on your language). You must sort them in descending order based on the value of the specified key.

The values will always be numbers, and the properties will always exist.
Your function should return a shallow copy of the input and not mutate the original list/array (i.e. not an in-place sort).
The sorting should be stable: two elements with the same value for a given sorting key should retain their relative order in the array.
Example
When sorted by "a", this:

[
  {"a": 1, "b": 3},
  {"a": 3, "b": 2},
  {"a": 2, "b": 40},
  {"a": 4, "b": 12}
]

should return:

[
  {"a": 4, "b": 12},
  {"a": 3, "b": 2},
  {"a": 2, "b": 40},
  {"a": 1, "b": 3}
]
